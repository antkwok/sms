        <summary>
          A simple library for sending transactional messages.

		  This library contains the core code without any hard dependencies. 
		  
		  There are three layers: 
			* Messaging - defines a message, a sending interface and a recieving interface. Also contains a factory to build senders and receieves
			* Routing - Allows services to send messages to named services (so clients dont need to know the protocol, port address username, password etc. of where the actual service is running)
			* Services - Builds on the routing and adds typed messages with serialization support.
